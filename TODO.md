# TODO

* Chessboard handle
	* castle
	* en passant
	* promotions

* Move saved game from session to storage, to even persist if browser is closed by mistake or whatever. Maybe not? So we can have one game per tab?

* Save moves history as well and re-play the game when loading it, to detect checkmate or whatever too.
